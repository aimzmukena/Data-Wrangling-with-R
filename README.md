# Data-Wrangling-with-R
A curated list of projects using R programming language to perform data cleansing on different datasets. Libraries used include tidyverse, lubridate, stringr, amongst others. All datasets are wrangled following the three rules of tidy dataset: 

"Each variable must have its own column.
Each observation must have its own row.
Each value must have its own cell."
